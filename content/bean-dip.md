## Ingredients
- 1 can refried beans
- 1 cup salsa
- 1 cup shredded cheese
- 3/4 cup sour cream
- 3 ounces cream cheese
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- tortilla chips

### Notes
This works fine with improvising around the ingredients, especially with
eliminating sour cream and cream cheese.

## Directions
1. combine ingredients in baking dish or slow cooker (not the chips, duh)
2. slow cooker: heat it through
3. oven: bake 20-30 minutes at 350 degrees
