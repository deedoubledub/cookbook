## Ingredients
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick)
- 3/4 cup Frank's hot sauce
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 3/4 teaspoon celery seed

#### Notes
- add more cayenne to increase heat

## Directions
1. combine everything except the butter in a saucepan
2. heat it up, but do not boil
3. add cold butter 1 pat at a time while stirring
4. when butter melts add another pat
5. when all butter is incorporated remove from heat

#### Notes
- at least when working with dairy-free butter, carefully manage the heat
- it needs to be hot enough to melt the butter, but any hotter will ruin the sauce
