## Ingredients
- 1 turkey
- - kosher salt
  - 4 tablespoons Simon & Garfunkel rub
  - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil or olive oil or water

## Directions
1. dry brine overnight; 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt per pound, less if pre-salted; don't cover with plastic to allow the sky to dry
2. spatchcock the bird
3. make a wet rub by combining herb rub with the oil
4. gently push the rub under the skin covering the breasts; spread it out and work it as far down to the thighs and legs as possible; avoid leaving behind large clumps
5. spread the remaining rub on top of the skin; if you run out, rub the exterior with oil and sprinkle it gently with a little black pepper, sage, and thyme; then sprinkle salt on the skin to help it crisp
6. cook on the grill with indirect heat at about 325 degrees; goes easy on the smoke wood, add just a bit at the very start, use fruit wood
8. after 30 to 60 minutes, when the wing tips and drumstick tips look nice and brown, grab 4 pieces of aluminum foil, each about 8" square, and coat one side with vegetable oil so it won't stick; cover the tops of the wings and drumsticks with the foil to prevent burning
9. cook to 160 to 165 degrees
